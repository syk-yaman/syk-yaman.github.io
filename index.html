        <p>
            I’m Yaman R.Kalaji, a Computer engineer from the University of Aleppo, Syria.
            Former co-founder & Technology Consultant at Beetronix
            Currently working on my MSc in Connected Environments at UCL, United Kingdom.

        <p>
            <b>Motivation</b> <br/>
            I think we are on a long mission in this life, building and innovating are the primary goals 
            especially for our country’s current condition.
            The first step should be creating a solid foundation, which it cannot be done by science alone, 
            but focusing on intellectual fields along with science and team-building is the way to go. 
            So I believe in finding the perfect balance between those three points is what will make us 
            a fully-capable community.        
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Interests and expertise fields:</b> <br/>
            I consider myself an inventor & innovator, with a passion to move team momentum toward a common goal. 
            I extremely enjoy entrepreneurship and working with startups.
            In the past decade, I’ve founded & worked on several projects in both industry and community and was a 
            tech lead in various domains. My expertise covers; Project Management, Business Process Management and 
            Technology Infrastructure Engineering.
            As for the research area; I’m currently working on my MSc, my focus has been directed toward Smart 
            Cities & Autonomous Vehicles after creating the first autonomous vehicle in Syria 
            (Yes, a real self-driving car in Syria, I understand if you’re surprised).
            I’m also an instructor and blogger with an enthusiasm for sustainable development, 
            open-source technology and open-access knowledge.

            <b>On a side note, what does “R.Kalaji” mean?</b> <br/>
            Well, that’s right, it’s a two-word last name. “Rawas” comes from ‘leader’, 
            and “Kalaji” comes from ‘citadel’.
            It’s the Citadel of Aleppo of course, where my ancestors lived between the 14th & 16th century.
            As for the ‘leader’ part, it’s related to their leadership in the carpet industry 
            profession between 16th & 17th centuries.
