            <b>Project abstract</b> <br/>
            This project presents designing and manufacturing the hardware and software of a low-cost robotic system, 
            which can be installed into any petrol car with an automatic gearbox, giving the ability to a car to be 
            driverless. The proposed approach is composed of three systems; first, a computer vision system detects 
            the lane located ahead of the vehicle to provide a reference angle for the steering wheel; second, to 
            make the proper decision, a control and collision avoidance system are implemented, which are responsible 
            for collecting sensors data and perform the right action by applying a closed-loop control system; third, 
            the electro-mechanical system, which physically controls the steering wheel, braking and accelerating of the 
            vehicle by actuators. The proposed system has been tested on-ground in several experiments and returned with 
            acceptable results.

            <b>Project Public Statement:</b> <br/>
            Self-driving cars are getting more attention these
            days; they will take an essential role in our
            future. What we have tried to achieve in this
            paper is designing a low-cost hardware system
            that can be installed on any car to be turned into
            an autonomous vehicle, this achievement facilitates
            to researchers from the entire globe to
            develop and maintain their research without the
            barrier of high cost. We used simple motors to
            steer the steering wheel and drive pedals of the
            vehicle. A computer takes feedback from cameras
            and sensors to recognize the surrounding
            environment and control the vehicle autonomously,
            preventing any collisions and following a
            pre-determined path.
