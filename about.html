            <b>What does it mean?</b> <br/>
            Well, it's my name 'Yaman' in the Arabic language. The used font is called 'Koufi' 
            which combines geometric shapes with alphabets to come up with a unique design for my name!

            <b>Who am I?</b> <br/>
            I'm a computer engineer from Aleppo, Syria, currently studying MSc in Connected Environments at University College London

            I consider myself an inventor and innovator, with the passion to move team momentum towards a common goal.
            In the past decade, I've founded and worked on several projects in both industry and community and was a tech lead in various domains. My expertise covers; Technology Infrastructure Engineering, Project Management, and Business Process Management. 
            As for the research area; my focus has been directed towards Smart Cities and Connected Environments after creating the first autonomous vehicle in Syria (Yes, real self-driving car in Syria, I understand if you're surprised).
            I'm also an instructor and blogger with an enthusiasm for sustainable development, open-source technology and open-access knowledge.
